The `pod` package
=========

The `pod` package contains implementations of the methods compared in 'Comparison of methods to identify aberrant expression patterns in individual patients: augmenting our toolkit for precision medicine'.  Currently, this is a bare-bones package however, I will be updating it periodically with documentation, new methods etc.
